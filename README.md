Smart Anti-Corruption System – Structure and Functions
1️⃣ System Definition

A software application that uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Blockchain technologies, focusing on:

Machine learning and predictive analytics to detect suspicious patterns in government data.

Big data analysis to uncover practices that may indicate financial or administrative corruption.

Blockchain to ensure data integrity and protect against tampering.

2️⃣ System Components
Component	Description	Technology
Database	Stores financial and administrative data securely	SQL / NoSQL / Data Lakes
Data Processing Layer	Cleans and prepares data for analysis	Python (pandas, numpy)
AI Analysis Layer	Detects suspicious patterns and predicts corruption	Machine Learning: Isolation Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks
Network & Text Analysis Layer	Analyzes relationships between employees and suppliers, contracts, and reports	NetworkX, NLP
Dashboard & Reporting	Displays analyses, risk alerts, and detailed reports	Dash, Plotly, Matplotlib
Blockchain Layer	Ensures data integrity and prevents manipulation	Blockchain, Smart Contracts
3️⃣ System Advantages

Big Data Analysis: Analyze large volumes of financial and administrative data accurately.

Transparency & Accountability: Enables monitoring of financial and administrative operations.

Early Corruption Detection: AI predicts illegal activities before they affect government operations.

Innovative Technologies: Combines AI and Blockchain to improve performance and data reliability.

4️⃣ System Goals

Improve Oversight: Reduce corruption opportunities through continuous monitoring of transactions.

Enhance Trust: Ensure government systems are transparent, building public trust.

Support Decision-Making: Provide accurate reports and insights to guide actions against corruption.

5️⃣ Applications in the Palestinian Public Sector

Monitor financial and administrative operations in ministries and government institutions.

Protect public funds from misuse or fraud.

Support internal auditing with alerts and smart analyses.

Predict financial and administrative risks for proactive action.

7️⃣ Python Demo Code (English Version)
# Smart Anti-Corruption System - Demo

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import networkx as nx
from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest

# ----------------------------
# 1️⃣ Create Sample Data
# ----------------------------
np.random.seed(42)

data = {
    'employee_id': range(1, 21),
    'department': np.random.choice(['Finance', 'HR', 'Procurement'], 20),
    'salary': np.random.randint(3000, 7000, 20),
    'expenses': np.random.randint(100, 5000, 20),
    'num_transactions': np.random.randint(1, 50, 20),
    'supplier_id': np.random.randint(1, 10, 20)
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Add anomalies to simulate corruption
df.loc[5, 'expenses'] = 15000
df.loc[12, 'num_transactions'] = 80

# ----------------------------
# 2️⃣ Clean Data
# ----------------------------
# Data is clean in this example. In real scenarios: df.dropna(), df.fillna(), df.duplicated()

# ----------------------------
# 3️⃣ Feature Engineering
# ----------------------------
features = df[['salary', 'expenses', 'num_transactions']]

# ----------------------------
# 4️⃣ Anomaly Detection
# ----------------------------
model = IsolationForest(contamination=0.1, random_state=42)
df['anomaly'] = model.fit_predict(features)
df['anomaly'] = df['anomaly'].map({1: 'Normal', -1: 'Suspicious'})

# ----------------------------
# 5️⃣ Network Analysis
# ----------------------------
G = nx.Graph()
for _, row in df.iterrows():
    G.add_edge(f"Emp{row['employee_id']}", f"Supplier{row['supplier_id']}")

plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
pos = nx.spring_layout(G)
nx.draw(G, pos, with_labels=True, node_color='skyblue', node_size=1500, edge_color='gray')
plt.title("Employee-Supplier Network")
plt.show()

# ----------------------------
# 6️⃣ Display Results
# ----------------------------
print("Anti-Corruption Detection Results:")
print(df[['employee_id', 'department', 'salary', 'expenses', 'num_transactions', 'anomaly']])

# Scatter plot for expenses vs transactions
plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
sns.scatterplot(data=df, x='expenses', y='num_transactions', hue='anomaly', palette=['green','red'], s=100)
plt.title("Suspicious Activity Detection - Expenses vs Transactions")
plt.xlabel("Expenses")
plt.ylabel("Number of Transactions")
plt.show()

Explanation of the Demo

Data Creation: Simulated employee financial and administrative records.

Anomalies Added: Simulate suspicious activities.

Feature Extraction: Use key financial features.

Anomaly Detection: Detect suspicious employees/transactions with IsolationForest.

Network Analysis: Visualize relationships between employees and suppliers.

Results Visualization: Table and scatter plot showing suspicious activities.

I can also create a more advanced version that includes:

NLP analysis of contracts/reports

Blockchain integration for data integrity

Automated alert system

Fully interactive dashboard
